Trying to tackle Advent of Code's 2016 problems.
Advent of Code can be, at times, quite fun, and it has helped me learn a lot on both Python and C++.
Although I've never been able to finish any year (I also haven't tried all of the years), I still like to try to solve as many problems as I can.

The code you'll find in here can be quite messy or bad. Everything in here is still part of the process of my education and practice.
